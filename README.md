# General Relativity and Inflation Systems Analysis Using GRTensor

This project involves the analysis and description of various General Relativity solutions and inflation models using the GRTensor package in Maple. The aim is to explore solutions like Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, and Kerr, and to model stellar structures using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. Additionally, a detailed study of slow-roll inflation models is conducted, focusing on different potential functions.
